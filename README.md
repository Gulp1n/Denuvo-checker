a simple program I made in node.js to check if Hogwarts Legacy can be pirated

## Instalation

node v12 or greater is needed. i used 19.7.0

after cloning the source code run  
```
npm i
```
to install all required modules

## Usage

when in the install folder with a terminal just run `node index.js` or `node .`  
it logs a happy face if its piratable and a sad face if not.

## Licence(I guess)

I dont care what you do with the code  
It isnt very sophisticated so I'm not expecting anyone to use it for something  
if you do use in a project it or modify it it'd be nice if you credit me but it doesnt really matter  
also im not trying to make a statement about J.K. rowling, just made this becuase I was bored
