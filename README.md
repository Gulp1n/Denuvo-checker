# Denuvo checker

a simple program I made in node.js to check if a denuvo game can be pirated

## Instalation

node v12 or greater is needed(I think didnt check). i used 19.7.0

after cloning the source code run  
```
npm i
```
to install all required modules

## Usage

when in the install folder with a terminal just run `node index.js` or `node .`  
it logs a happy face if its piratable and a sad face if not.  
to select a game to scan run `node test.js` and select one from the list.  
this will write it to the json file and scan for this game every time you run the `index.js` file

## Licence(I guess)

I dont care what you do with the code  
It isnt very sophisticated so I'm not expecting anyone to use it for something  
if you do use in a project it or modify it it'd be nice if you credit me but it doesnt really matter
